# thinkNXG ESS Portal

Enterprise Employee Self-Service for **thinkNXG HR v16** — a Vue 3 + TypeScript PWA served at `/ess` by a custom thinkNXG app, for employees, managers and HR.

The portal is an experience layer. Attendance, leave, payroll, expenses, performance and workflows stay in thinkNXG HR; the app never re-implements leave maths, payroll or accounting. Custom DocTypes exist only for capabilities thinkNXG HR doesn't have (helpdesk, letters, recognition, AI audit, policies, delegation).

```
Vue 3 PWA (/ess)    ──  Router guards, Pinia, in-memory server cache, offline queue
        │  same-origin session + CSRF, no API keys in the browser
thinkNXG API layer  ──  thinknxg_ess_portal.api.*  (identity → scope → validation → idempotency → audit)
        │
Native thinkNXG HR  ──  Employee, Checkin, Attendance(+Request), Leave Application/Allocation/Ledger,
                        Salary Slip, Expense Claim, Employee Advance, Shift Request, Shift Assignment, Goal, Appraisal, Training
Custom ESS          ──  39 DocTypes in module "ESS Portal"
Infra               ──  MariaDB · Redis (cache, rate limits, AI transcripts) · RQ jobs · scheduler · private files
```

## Install

```bash
cd frappe-bench
bench get-app /path/to/thinknxg_ess_portal        # or your git remote
bench --site your.site install-app thinknxg_ess_portal
bench --site your.site migrate
bench build --app thinknxg_ess_portal              # copies the prebuilt SPA into /assets
```

The zip ships with the frontend already built (`thinknxg_ess_portal/public/ess`, `www/ess.html`), so Node is not needed on the server. To rebuild:

```bash
cd apps/thinknxg_ess_portal/frontend
npm ci && npm run build        # type-check, Vite build, writes www/ess.html, stamps the service worker
npm run dev                    # http://localhost:8080/ess, proxies /api to FRAPPE_URL (default :8000)
npm test                       # Vitest
```

Requires `frappe`, `erpnext`, `hrms` (v16). Optional: `pip install pypdf` (index PDF policies), `pywebpush` (push notifications).

**After install**
1. Assign roles: `ESS Portal Admin`, `ESS HR Agent`, `ESS Payroll Officer`, `ESS Department Head` (created on install). Set *ESS Department Head* on Department records if department heads need team scope.
2. Open **ESS Portal Settings**: brand, module toggles, attendance rules, SLA defaults, AI provider + key, VAPID keys.
3. Add **ESS Knowledge Source** records (policies/FAQs) for the assistant; edit the two seeded **ESS Document Templates** and set a Letter Head.
4. Seeded: 7 helpdesk categories (incl. confidential *Payroll & Salary*, *Visa & Residency*), 5 recognition values, 7 badges.

## Roles and scope

| Capability | Employee | Manager (derived) | HR User / HR Manager | ESS HR Agent | ESS Payroll Officer | ESS Portal Admin |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Own profile, attendance, leave, payslips, expenses | ✔ | ✔ | ✔ | if employee | if employee | if employee |
| Team attendance, calendar, approvals | – | reporting line (recursive) + headed departments + active delegations | company scope / all | – | – | – |
| Other employees' payslips | – | – | HR Manager (audited) | – | ✔ (audited) | – |
| HR tickets | own | own | all | non-confidential + assigned | confidential + assigned | all |
| Generate letters | eligible templates | eligible | approve per template role | – | – | ✔ |
| Analytics | own | team aggregates | HR scope, k-anonymised | – | – | – |
| Portal configuration, AI sources, audit trail | – | – | – | – | – | ✔ |

"Manager" is never a role check — it is derived per request from `Employee.reports_to` (recursive) and `Department.ess_department_head`. Every API derives identity from `frappe.session.user`; no endpoint accepts an employee id for the caller's own data. Router guards only shape navigation.

Record-level rules for custom DocTypes are enforced in `permissions/__init__.py` via `permission_query_conditions` and `has_permission`, so Desk and `/api/resource` cannot widen access either.

All mutations accept `client_request_id`; `services/idempotency.run_once` records it in **ESS Offline Action**, so retries, double taps and offline replays never duplicate a request. Reads are GET-only, mutations POST-only.

Custom fields: `Department.ess_department_head`, `Attendance Request.ess_status` / `ess_review_comment` (thinkNXG HR has no rejected state for drafts), `Shift Assignment.ess_roster` (marks assignments a roster owns), `Shift Type.ess_code` / `ess_color` (grid labels), `Employee Checkin.ess_source` / `ess_accuracy` / `ess_location` / `ess_distance` / `ess_log` (portal punch context; device and Desk punches leave them empty).

## How the key flows work

- **Check-in** — see *Employee check-in control* below. Server time only; never queued offline.
- **Leave** — balances from `get_leave_details`, days from `get_number_of_leave_days`, balance from `get_leave_balance_on`; overlap/holiday preview recalculated server-side on every date change and again at submit.
- **Approvals** — a request is actionable only if it is in the caller's computed pending list (approver field, reporting line, HR role, or active delegation). If a thinkNXG Workflow exists for the DocType, the matching workflow action is applied instead of setting status. Rejections require a reason. Every decision writes an ESS Audit Event.
- **Delegation** — hourly job shares open documents with the delegate and revokes on expiry.
- **Letters** — HR-authored Jinja templates (validated, versioned on change); employees pick a template, never fields or code. Eligibility (status, service months, monthly limit), optional approval by template role, PDF rendered in a background job, stored as a private File, verification code + public `/ess-verify` page (rate-limited, toggleable).
- **Helpdesk** — SLA due dates from category; transition map enforced in the controller; 15-minute escalation job (level 1 → category escalation user, level 2+ → HR Managers); internal notes never leave the server for employees; auto-close after N days.
- **Recognition** — monthly points budget per sender, optional HR moderation, no self-recognition, rule badges (anniversary, recognitions received/given, training, onboarding, policies). No rankings, nothing tied to hours or attendance.
- **Analytics** — server-side aggregates only; HR breakdowns below `min_group_size` (default 5) are suppressed; daily snapshot table for trend reporting.

## Employee check-in control

Settings live in **ESS Portal Settings → Employee Check-in / Geolocation** and in the portal at **HR operations → Check-in control** (HR Managers and ESS Portal Admins edit; HR Users view).

| Setting | Effect |
|---|---|
| Global employee check-in | Default permission for portal users. |
| Employee permission policy | *Allow employee-specific overrides*: an ESS Checkin Policy can allow or deny one person against the default. *Enforce global setting for everyone*: overrides are ignored. |
| Require GPS verification | Location must be captured before a punch is accepted. |
| Geofence enforcement | *Enforce geofence* (must be inside a permitted location) or *Record location only*. |
| Allowed geofence radius | Default radius for locations without their own. |
| Maximum GPS accuracy uncertainty | A fix reported worse than this (e.g. ±50 m) is refused with a specific message. |
| Allow check-in only during assigned shift window | IN punches only between *shift start − early minutes* and *shift end + late minutes*, from the Shift Type's own buffers (portal defaults when they are 0). Overnight shifts are handled. |
| Allow check-in on days without a shift | Otherwise rest days, holidays and unassigned days refuse IN punches. |

Per-employee **ESS Checkin Policy**: portal access (Inherit/Allow/Deny), GPS (Inherit/Required/Exempt), shift window (Inherit/Enforce/Don't enforce), radius and accuracy overrides, extra or exclusive locations, validity dates and a mandatory reason. Every change is written to ESS Audit Event.

**Permitted locations** for a punch are the Shift Location on the employee's current Shift Assignment (if enabled), active **ESS Checkin Locations** that apply to the employee (all, company, branch or department), and any locations listed on their override. *Only these locations* restricts them to the override's list.

**Decision order** (`services/checkin_policy.evaluate`): portal access → punch sequence (no double IN; OUT needs an open IN in the last 20 hours) → cooldown → shift window or no-shift rule → GPS presence, accuracy, geofence → risk flags. Every attempt, allowed or denied, writes an **ESS Checkin Log** with server and device time, coordinates, accuracy, matched or nearest location and distance, shift window, risk flags, IP, user agent and the full policy trace. HR can filter and export it at **HR operations → Check-in audit**.

**Channels are independent.** These rules apply only to `attendance.check_in`/`check_out`. Biometric devices posting to the Employee Checkin API and HR staff in Desk are untouched, so turning portal check-in off never stops a device integration.

**thinkNXG HR's own rule still applies.** If *HR Settings → Allow Geolocation Tracking* is on, thinkNXG HR validates every Employee Checkin against the Shift Location radius and requires coordinates. An ESS GPS exemption or an extra ESS location cannot override that; the portal reports it as `NATIVE_VALIDATION` and the settings page warns when it is on. Turn it off if ESS should be the single decision-maker.

**About GPS.** Browsers share location only over HTTPS (or localhost) and only with the employee's permission; the page explains each failure (blocked, unavailable, timeout, insecure). The server re-checks every coordinate, but a phone's reported position can't prove physical presence. Risk flags (unrealistic ±0 m accuracy, travel faster than *max travel speed*, coordinates identical to another day's) are logged for review and can optionally block.

## Rosters

**Employees** get *My roster* (week and month views, shift times, check-in window, location, rest days, holidays, leave), *Holidays* (year view, next holiday, weekly offs, .ics download) and can request a **shift change**, a **rest day** or a **swap with a colleague**. A swap goes to the colleague first, then to the approver (the roster's planner, or the reporting manager). Requests need the configured notice and must fall on a published roster. They appear in the existing Approvals queue as *Roster changes*.

**Managers and HR** use the **Roster planner**: paint shifts with click, drag or keyboard; apply rotation patterns (e.g. 2 days, 2 evenings, 1 night, 2 off) with a per-person stagger; copy a previous roster (whole weeks repeat so weekdays line up); set coverage needs per shift and weekday. Live checks cover overlapping shifts, minimum rest, maximum consecutive days, maximum weekly hours, coverage gaps, leave clashes, people on two rosters, default shifts on rest days, and manual Shift Assignments in the way. Managers can only roster their own reporting line; HR works within its scope.

**Publishing** writes native **Shift Assignments**, one per run of identical days, tagged with `ess_roster`, so thinkNXG HR auto-attendance, shift-based check-in linking and payroll keep working as they do today:
- Only today onward is written. Past days are locked once published and never rewritten.
- Republishing ends or cancels the roster's own future assignments and recreates them; untagged (manual) assignments are never touched unless HR ticks *trim manual assignments*, which ends or deactivates them with a comment.
- Rest days get no assignment. If an employee also has a **default shift**, thinkNXG HR falls back to it on rest days and may mark absence, so the planner warns; clear default shifts for rostered staff.
- People whose plan changed are notified. Each publish is recorded in ESS Audit Event.

## AI HR assistant

`services/assistant.py` → identity check → module/rate limit → deterministic refusal guard for other people's pay/personal data → redaction (IBAN, card/account numbers, emails, phones) → model with **allow-listed tools** → proposal.

- Tools (`services/ai_tools.py`) take **no identity arguments**; any `employee`/`user` argument a model invents is stripped. Data always comes from the session employee, so "show me Ahmed's payslip" cannot succeed even if the model tries.
- Policy answers come from BM25 retrieval over **ESS Knowledge Chunk**, filtered by audience/company/department *before* scoring, cited as [1], [2]. Retrieved text is labelled as data in the system prompt.
- Consequential actions (leave request, HR ticket) are returned as proposals held in Redis for 15 minutes; the employee confirms in a card, and the normal API (with validation and idempotency) runs.
- Payslip amounts are hidden from the model unless `ai_allow_salary_answers` is on.
- Providers: Anthropic Messages API or any OpenAI-compatible endpoint; key stored as a Password field, server-side only. With the provider *Disabled*, the assistant still works in deterministic mode (intent routing + policy excerpts + "raise a ticket" proposal).
- Audit stores metadata only (intent, tools, sources, outcome, latency, redaction count, feedback). Transcripts live in Redis for 24 h. Retention job purges metadata after `ai_retention_days`.

## PWA

Manifest + icons under `/assets/thinknxg_ess_portal/ess/`, service worker served from `www/ess-sw.js` with scope `/ess`. Hashed assets cache-first; navigation network-first with an offline page; `/api`, `/files`, `/private` are never cached. Leave requests, tickets and recognition can be queued offline (state shown as Queued → Submitted → Confirmed) and replay with the same request id; check-in and approvals require a live server confirmation. Web Push via VAPID (optional `pywebpush`); payloads carry only a title and route. Logout clears caches and the offline queue.

EN/AR with full RTL, light/dark/system themes, keyboard command palette (Ctrl/⌘ K), skip link, focus-trapped dialogs, reduced-motion support, touch-sized controls and a bottom tab bar with a centre punch button on mobile.

## Tests

- `thinknxg_ess_portal/tests/test_pure.py` — 17 unit tests for geofence maths, accuracy rules, risk flags, shift windows (including overnight and thinkNXG's timedelta times), roster rules, coverage and rotation patterns. Runs without a bench: `python -m pytest thinknxg_ess_portal/tests/test_pure.py`.
- `thinknxg_ess_portal/tests/test_checkin_roster.py` — integration tests: global off vs. Allow override, *Enforce global* ignoring overrides, Deny override writing a denied log, outside-geofence and poor-accuracy refusals, GPS exemption, shift-window enforcement, managers blocked from rostering outside their team, publish creating tagged assignments and republish replacing them, swap needing colleague acceptance before it reaches the manager.

- `thinknxg_ess_portal/tests/test_security.py` — colleague ticket isolation, confidential tickets hidden from agents, internal notes hidden, manager scope = reporting line, non-manager blocked from team member, unauthorised approval blocked, protected profile fields rejected, idempotent duplicate submission, assistant refusal for a colleague's payslip, AI tool identity stripping, self-recognition blocked.
  `bench --site test.site run-tests --app thinknxg_ess_portal`
- `frontend/tests/unit.spec.ts` — markdown XSS escaping and link allow-list, offline queue rules, format helpers (`npm test`).

## Notes and assumptions to verify on your bench

- Python package is `thinknxg_ess_portal` (thinkNXG requires the package to match the app name), so methods are `thinknxg_ess_portal.api.*` rather than `ess_portal.api.*`.
- Field names follow thinkNXG HR v16 and are guarded with `meta.has_field` where they vary (Checkin latitude/longitude, Shift Location, Overtime Slip, Employee Benefit Ledger, Goal, Onboarding). Confirm against your installed release and customisations.
- Expense claims are created as drafts with the company's default payable account; submission/payment stays with Accounts unless *Auto-submit approved expenses* is enabled. Employee Advance uses the company's default advance account.
- The UI uses its own lightweight component set rather than `frappe-ui`, to keep the build reproducible; it can be swapped in later without touching the API layer.
- Realtime events are published (`ess_notification`, `ess_ticket_update`); the SPA polls unread counts every 60 s and does not require socket.io.
